# CSharp-Projects

This is where all of my projects written in C# will be stored. To run the projects, download and copy/paste all of the provided files into its own folder, and then run the .exe file. C# is the language I would consider myself most comfortable in so there may be more complex projects and games uplodaded here.

As always, please let me know if you have any suggestions for code improvements or ideas for future projects.
