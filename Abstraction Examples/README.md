## Abstraction Examples

The goal of this project is to show an example of using an abstract class and abstract methods.
Abstract classes are best used when you want to provide a common functionality among all classes 
derived from it without letting an instance of the parent class being instantiated. In this project
specifically, there is a class named AreaClass and there are several other classes that inherit from it
to be able to calculate the area and perimiter/volume of different shapes.
